# MORSE-CODE-TRANSLATOR-USING-MSP432-
The aim of this project is to implement Morse code communication using the MSP432 
microcontroller and the onboard LED. Morse code is a method of transmitting text information 
as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks, representing letters, numbers, and punctuation. By 
utilizing the MSP432 microcontroller and its onboard LED, we can create a simple yet effective 
Morse code communication system.
